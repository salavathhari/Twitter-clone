## Features

- User registration and authentication (JWT)
- Create, read and list tweets
- Profile pages and basic UI for posting and viewing tweets
- Small example of server-side API (Express) + client (React)

## Repository structure

Top-level layout (abridged):

- `backend/` — Express API, controllers, models, routes and configuration
- `frontend/twitterclone/` — React app (Create React App structure)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`, `SETUP_GUIDE.md`, and other project docs

Paths you will likely use:

- `backend/index.js` — Backend entry point
- `backend/package.json` — Backend dependencies & scripts
- `frontend/twitterclone/package.json` — Frontend dependencies & scripts

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended LTS, >= 16)
- npm (or yarn)
- A running MongoDB instance (local or Atlas) if using the default backend model
- Git for cloning/pushing

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder (or set env vars in your environment) with values similar to:

- `PORT` — port for the backend (default: 5000)
- `MONGO_URI` — MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` — secret used to sign JWT tokens

Example `.env` (do not commit real secrets):

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/twitter-clone
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
```

## Install and run (development)

Open two terminals (one for backend, one for frontend). These example commands are for PowerShell.

### Backend

1. Install dependencies and start the backend:

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev   # or `node index.js` depending on available scripts
```

The backend listens on the port defined in `PORT` (default 5000).

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies and start the React development server:

```powershell
cd frontend/twitterclone
npm install
npm start
```

The React app will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build & deploy

For production builds:

Backend: ensure `NODE_ENV=production` and run your Node/PM2/docker deployment as desired.

Frontend: create a production build inside `frontend/twitterclone`:

```powershell
cd frontend/twitterclone
npm run build
```

You can then serve the static `build/` output with any static host or integrate it into the backend.

## Git / pushing to GitHub

This repository is intended to be pushed to a GitHub repo named `Twitter-clone`. To add a remote and push your code (example PowerShell commands):

```powershell
# add remote (only if remote is not already configured — replace URL with your repo)
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/Twitter-clone.git

# push main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Twitter-clone project"
git push -u origin main
```

If `origin` already exists and points at another URL, update it with:

```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your-username>/Twitter-clone.git
```

Note: GitHub authentication will be handled locally (PAT or SSH depending on your setup).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Open an issue or submit a pull request. Keep changes small and include a descriptive commit message.

Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Make changes and add tests where possible.
4. Open a pull request describing your changes.

## License

This project does not include a chosen license file. Add a `LICENSE` file to make licensing terms explicit.

---

If you'd like, I can:

- Add a sample `.env.example` file in `backend/`.
- Create a minimal `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for CI.
- Help push this repo to your GitHub account (I can add remote and run git push commands but you will need to complete authentication locally).

Tell me what you'd like next.
